It featured a production team led by director Shinichir\u014d Watanabe, screenwriter Keiko Nobumoto, character designer Toshihiro Kawamoto, mechanical designer Kimitoshi Yamane, and composer Yoko Kanno. The twenty-six episodes of the series are set in the year 2071. It follows the adventures, misadventures and tragedies of a bounty hunter crew travelling on the Bebop, their starship. Cowboy Bebop explores philosophical concepts including existentialism, existential ennui, loneliness, and the past's influence.\n\nThe series premiered in Japan on TV Tokyo from April 3 until June 26, 1998, broadcasting only twelve episodes and a special due to its controversial adult-themed content. The entire twenty-six episodes of the series were later broadcast on WOWOW from October 24 until April 24, 1999. The anime was adapted into two manga series which were serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's Asuka Fantasy DX. A film was later released to theaters worldwide.\n\nCowboy Bebop became a critical and commercial success both in Japanese and international markets (most notably in the United States), garnered several major anime and science fiction awards upon its release, and received universal praise for its style, characters, story, voice acting, animation, and soundtrack. In the years since its release, critics and reviewers, from the United States in particular, have hailed Cowboy Bebop as a masterpiece and frequently cite it as one of the greatest anime titles of all time. Credited with helping to introduce anime to a new wave of Western viewers in the early 2000s, Cowboy Bebop has also been labelled a gateway series for the medium as a whole.", "popularity": 13.781133, "original_name": "\u30ab\u30a6\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30d3\u30d0\u30c3\u30d7", "id": 30991, "vote_average": 8.3, "vote_count": 127, "first_air_date": "1998-04-03", "original_language": "ja", "backdrop_path": "/kEc2CBiPjX1HrwLdCDXmXnHvHlW.jpg", "genre_ids": [16, 18, 10759, 10765]}, {"origin_country": ["US"], "poster_path": "/esKFbCWAGyUUNshT5HE5BIpvbcL.jpg", "name": "Stranger Things", "overview": "When a young boy vanishes, a small town uncovers a mystery involving secret experiments, terrifying supernatural forces, and one strange little girl.", "popularity": 42.804922, "original_name": "Stranger Things", "id": 66732, "vote_average": 8.3, "vote_count": 867, "first_air_date": "2016-07-15", "original_language": "en", "backdrop_path": "/6c4weB3UycHwPgzv31Awt7nku9y.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 9648, 10765]}, {"origin_country": ["JP"], "poster_path": "/d8KcK1f3Uxj5Rp86d9XQLsG69ZX.jpg", "name": "Hunter x Hunter", "overview": "Twelve-year-old Gon Freecss one day discovers that the father he had always been told was dead was alive and well.

It also featured animations by Terry Gilliam, often sequenced or merged with live action. The first episode was recorded on 7 September and broadcast on 5 October 1969 on BBC One, with 45 episodes airing over four series from 1969 to 1974, plus two episodes for German TV.\n\nThe show often targets the idiosyncrasies of British life, especially that of professionals, and is at times politically charged. The members of Monty Python were highly educated. Terry Jones and Michael Palin are Oxford University graduates; Eric Idle, John Cleese, and Graham Chapman attended Cambridge University; and American-born member Terry Gilliam is an Occidental College graduate. Their comedy is often pointedly intellectual, with numerous erudite references to philosophers and literary figures. The series followed and elaborated upon the style used by Spike Milligan in his ground breaking series Q5, rather than the traditional sketch show format.
